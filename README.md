### Hey!

I'm a german cs-student at KIT, currently in my Bachelors degree.

I'm interested in many different topics, like mobile app development or database management.

My favorite projects so far include:
- The [Civoris](https://github.com/civoris/) tool-suite that allows an organization to manage internal rulesets. Consists of
  - A multiplatform client (Android, Windows, Linux)
  - A jvm server that connects to a postgres database
  - A react web-client
- [OneUI-Compose](https://github.com/TrainerSnow/oneui-compose), a design-library to use the [One UI 4](https://www.samsung.com/de/explore/brand/your-galaxy-your-way-mit-one-ui4/) style by Samsung in Jetpack Compose apps
- [OneUI Dream Diary](https://github.com/TrainerSnow/oneui-DreamDiary), an android app to track, manage and analyse your dreams, using the `OneUI-Compose` library

A bit more experimental project can be found [here](https://github.com/SimonBumiller/Car_Game_NN). I created this project for my biology classes, to show how Computer Science and Biology can be connected, mainly using **Neural Networks** and **Evolutionary Algorithms**

In the future, I'm planning to continue developing these projects as well as learning more about Web development.
