### Hello there!

I'm a german student, interested in topics like machine learning and android app development.

My biggest projects so far include:
- [OneUI-Compose](https://github.com/TrainerSnow/oneui-compose), a library to use ONEUI-design in Jetpack Compose apps
- [OneUI Dream Diary](https://github.com/TrainerSnow/oneui-DreamDiary), an android app to track your dreams, using the `OneUI-Compose` library


In the future, I'm planning to continue developing these projects as well as learning more about Web development.
